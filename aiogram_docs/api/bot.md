# Bot

Bot instance can be created from `aiogram.Bot`
(`from aiogram import Bot`) and you can\'t use methods without instance
of bot with configured token.

This class has aliases for all methods and named in `lower_camel_case`.

For example `sendMessage` named `send_message` and has the same
specification with all class-based methods.
