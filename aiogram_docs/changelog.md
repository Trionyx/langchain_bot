        ...
    )
    ```

    [#1194](https://github.com/aiogram/aiogram/issues/1194)

-   Updated keyboard builders with new methods for integrating buttons
    and keyboard creation more seamlessly. Added functionality to create
    buttons from existing markup and attach another builder. This
    improvement aims to make the keyboard building process more
    user-friendly and flexible.

    Bot]{.title-ref} argument to the `.read(...)` method, so, from now
    URLInputFile can be used without specifying bot instance.
    [#1238](https://github.com/aiogram/aiogram/issues/1238)
-   Code-generated `__init__` typehints in types and methods to make IDE
    happy without additional pydantic plugin
    [#1245](https://github.com/aiogram/aiogram/issues/1245)

## 3.0.0b9 (2023-07-30)

### Features

-   Added new shortcuts for
    `aiogram.types.chat_member_updated.ChatMemberUpdated`{.interpreted-text
    role="class"} to send message to chat that member joined/left.
    [#1234](https://github.com/aiogram/aiogram/issues/1234)

    [#1232](https://github.com/aiogram/aiogram/issues/1232)
-   Added model validation to remove UNSET before field validation. This
    change was necessary to correctly handle parse_mode where \'UNSET\'
    is used as a sentinel value. Without the removal of \'UNSET\', it
    would create issues when passed to model initialization from
    Bot.method_name. \'UNSET\' was also added to typing.
    [#1233](https://github.com/aiogram/aiogram/issues/1233)
-   Updated pydantic to 2.1 with few bugfixes

### Improved Documentation

### Deprecations and Removals

-   Removed the use of the context instance (Bot.get_current) from all
    placements that were used previously. This is to avoid the use of
    the context instance in the wrong place.
    [#1230](https://github.com/aiogram/aiogram/issues/1230)

## 3.0.0b8 (2023-07-17)

### Features

-   Added possibility to use custom events in routers (If router does
    not support custom event it does not break and passes it to included
    routers). [#1147](https://github.com/aiogram/aiogram/issues/1147)

-   Added support for FSM in Forum topics.

    The strategy can be changed in dispatcher:

    ``` python
    from aiogram.fsm.strategy import FSMStrategy
    ...
    dispatcher = Dispatcher(
        fsm_strategy=FSMStrategy.USER_IN_TOPIC,
        storage=...,  # Any persistent storage
    )
    ```

    ::: note
    ::: title
    Note
    :::

    If you have implemented you own storages you should extend record
    key generation with new one attribute - `thread_id`
    :::

    [#1161](https://github.com/aiogram/aiogram/issues/1161)

-   Improved CallbackData serialization.

    -   Minimized UUID (hex without dashes)

    \- Replaced bool values with int (true=1, false=0)
    [#1163](https://github.com/aiogram/aiogram/issues/1163)

-   Added a tool to make text formatting flexible and easy. More details
    on the
    `corresponding documentation page <formatting-tool>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} [#1172](https://github.com/aiogram/aiogram/issues/1172)

-   Added `X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token` header check
    [#1173](https://github.com/aiogram/aiogram/issues/1173)

-   Made `allowed_updates` list to revolve automatically in
    start_polling method if not set explicitly.
    [#1178](https://github.com/aiogram/aiogram/issues/1178)

-   Added possibility to pass custom headers to
    `URLInputFile`{.interpreted-text role="class"} object
    [#1191](https://github.com/aiogram/aiogram/issues/1191)

### Bugfixes

-   Change type of result in InlineQueryResult enum for
    `InlineQueryResultCachedMpeg4Gif` and `InlineQueryResultMpeg4Gif` to
    more correct according to documentation.

    Change regexp for entities parsing to more correct
    (`InlineQueryResultType.yml`).
    [#1146](https://github.com/aiogram/aiogram/issues/1146)

-   Fixed signature of startup/shutdown events to include the
    `**dispatcher.workflow_data` as the handler arguments.
    [#1155](https://github.com/aiogram/aiogram/issues/1155)

-   Added missing `FORUM_TOPIC_EDITED` value to content_type property
    [#1160](https://github.com/aiogram/aiogram/issues/1160)

-   Fixed compatibility with Python 3.8-3.9 (from previous release)
    [#1162](https://github.com/aiogram/aiogram/issues/1162)

-   Fixed the markdown spoiler parser.
    [#1176](https://github.com/aiogram/aiogram/issues/1176)

-   Fixed workflow data propagation
    [#1196](https://github.com/aiogram/aiogram/issues/1196)

-   Fixed the serialization error associated with nested subtypes like
    InputMedia, ChatMember, etc.

    The previously generated code resulted in an invalid schema under
    pydantic v2, which has stricter type parsing. Hence, subtypes
    without the specification of all subtype unions were generating an
    empty object. This has been rectified now.
    [#1213](https://github.com/aiogram/aiogram/issues/1213)

### Improved Documentation

-   Changed small grammar typos for `upload_file`
    [#1133](https://github.com/aiogram/aiogram/issues/1133)

### Deprecations and Removals

-   Removed text filter in due to is planned to remove this filter few
    versions ago.

    Use `F.text` instead
    [#1170](https://github.com/aiogram/aiogram/issues/1170)

### Misc

-   Added full support of [Bot API
    6.6](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api-changelog#march-9-2023)

    `protect_content` in addition to `parse_mode` to the Bot instance,
    reworked internal request builder mechanism.

## 3.0.0b7 (2023-02-18)

::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

Note that this version has incompatibility with Python 3.8-3.9 in case
when you create an instance of Dispatcher outside of the any coroutine.

Sorry for the inconvenience, it will be fixed in the next version.

This code will not work:

``` python
dp = Dispatcher()

def main():
    ...
    dp.run_polling(...)

main()
```

But if you change it like this it should works as well:

``` python
router = Router()

async def main():
    dp = Dispatcher()
    dp.include_router(router)
    ...
    dp.start_polling(...)

asyncio.run(main())
```

    you try to pass wrong type of argument to the filter but don\'t know
    why filter is not resolved now you can get error like this:

    aiogram.exceptions.FiltersResolveError: Unknown keyword filters: {'content_types'}
      Possible cases:
      - 1 validation error for ContentTypesFilter
        content_types

    filter event by data from middlewares or other filters

    For example your bot is running with argument named `config` that

    from this config:

    ``` python3
    @router.message(magic_data=F.event.from_user.id == F.config.admin_id)
    ...
    ```
